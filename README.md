# LiftLog
LiftLog - Interactive gym progress app.

LiftLog is a passion project created to track my own fitness progress and learn more about full-stack development using the MNNN stack.

The main idea behind liftlog was to test how an interactive gym map would work within a fitness tracking app.
Allowing users to select their relevant machines for their workout and update their progress (current weight, reps etc).

LiftLog features 
  - NestJS backend deployed via Railway.
  - NextJS promotional website deployed via Vercel.
  - React-native IOS/Android application developed with Expo.
